Evase is an all-in-one platform designed for users to automate modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow. We use several supported platforms to help users boot up their projects.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Static Site Generators:</h4>
Site generators are designed to automatically create and deploy with a single click of the button. You can choose the type of static websites you wish to generate. For these sites to generate we will use platforms such as Vercel & Netlify. Additional addons such as a headless CMS is provided for Netlify but not vercel. Vercel dedicates to static single pages for fast cache and prerendering like Netlify. To create a project and new repo, Netlify & Vercel both use Github.
